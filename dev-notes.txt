DEV Notes: Alexandria Media Manager

- give option to add files to primary if they are unexpectedly found on a backup drive (currently only option is to delete off backup)
- detect seasons that are not present on primary drives but are on backup drives (give option to add to primary or delete from backup)
- detect when file names are the same but file extensions are different (likely because the primary file was updated)
- give suggestions (largest size, most polific backed up shows, or imdb rating) for deletion in backup drive to clear up space
- detect when shows on whitelist are not on the primary and delete them from the whitelist
- necessary output files:
    shoe details (size, num of seasons, num of episodes, rating)
- show space remaining on all drives
- delete movie folders without any movie files in them, but that may have images or subtitle files (issue on Vaughn)
- add an api feature that determines if all the episodes for a show are in alexandria
- edit backup list output to save shows in key-value pairs with key fields Title, Year, num episodes, size (to get show specific file data)
- backup output files to backup folder

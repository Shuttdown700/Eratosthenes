DEV Notes: Alexandria Media Manager

- a function that backs up all nfo, jpg, png, etc files in the exact same folder structure as the primaries
- function that prints the closest movie release date to your birthday
- idea: create 2x2 matrix of genre tags which counts the number of times tags are paired together in a movie
- [ERROR HANDLING] handle the error of if a drive disconnects and returns a None letter
- give option to remove media info for files not currently present instead of immediently removing that data
- give option to add files to primary if they are unexpectedly found on a backup drive (currently only option is to delete off backup)
- detect seasons that are not present on primary drives but are on backup drives (give option to add to primary or delete from backup)
- detect when filenames are the same but file extensions are different in the same directory (likely because the primary file was updated)
- give suggestions (largest size, most polific backed up shows, or imdb rating) for deletion in backup drive to clear up space
- detect when shows on whitelist are not on the primary and delete them from the whitelist (for finding mispellings and old naming conventions)
- necessary output files:
    shoe details (size, num of seasons, num of episodes, rating)
- **delete movie folders without any movie files in them, but that may have images or subtitle files (issue on Vaughn)
- add an api feature that determines if all the episodes for a show are in alexandria (mimic Statistics plugin in Emby)
- edit backup list output to save shows in key-value pairs with key fields Title, Year, num episodes, size (to get show specific file data)
- add a minimum year field to the backup config (block old movie backups)
- create an analytics that identifies the X number of highest rated movies of a decade / category
- add a max size field to the backup config (prevents backup of oversized files)
- detect movie files saved in folders that do not share the exact same name
- *Gree has shows but isn't a designated backup drive???
- add genre whitelist & blacklist for the movie backups
- do show backup analysis on how many drives allegedly have copies of shows
- when reading file details, determine if there are 'N/A' values currently saved and seek to resolve them
- create a function that generate the print statement for sizes, automatically shifting between TB & GB
- for movies, a config setting to backup all movies from a year and onward
- add methods to quickly edit the config files
- after deleting files from a backup drive, rescan the backup drive to get a current file list
- add recent movie forced backup
- add genre backup block
- the get_video_media_info function in the analytics file does not work with mkv files!!!
- duplicate values in media output file, example in "All About Eve"
- add a zeroization feature
- remove bitrates datapoints from details pull
- find instances where multiple movie files are in the same movie folder
- transition to a class-based backup feature to store/update persistant data
- movie imdb optimization if movies don't fit or to fill space (backup shows first)
- check for .nfo or .srt files in movie dir that are not the same name as the movie file
- analytic output that identifies what media exists on what drives, includes a timestamp
- analytic that goes through the whitelists to determine backup overlap
- create a function that parsed media details to find shows with .mp4 and h264 to suggest upgrades
- create a suite of file validators: correct format, no duplicate filenames, no rogue srt files

- add something that goes through whitelists to determine theoretical backup

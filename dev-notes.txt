DEV Notes: Alexandria Media Manager

- import modules locally
- outsource hardcoded portions to json files
- give option to add shows to primary if they are unexpectedly found on a backup drive (currently only option is to delete off backup)
- detect seasons that are not present on primary drives but are on backup drives (give option to add to primary or delete from backup)
- detect when file names are the same but file extensions are different (likely because the primary file was updated)
- this process needs to conduct an integrity check to also detect file size changes following expected file rewrites
- give suggestions (largest size, most polific backed up shows, or imdb rating) for deletion in backup drive to clear up space
- find a different method of adding color to text (need more flexibility)
- detect when shows on whitelist are not on the primary and delete them
- switch anime drive from Echo to Appo
- backup subtitles with main files
- add ytdl to youtube functionality
- necessary output files:
    movies not backed up | backed up once | multi backups
    shows not backed up | backed up once | multi backups
    shoe details (size, num of seasons, num of episodes, rating)
    entire listings of shows & movies
- show space remaining on all drives
- show backup surface area on all connected drives
- show backup surface area on all whtielist files
- delete movie folders without any movie files in them

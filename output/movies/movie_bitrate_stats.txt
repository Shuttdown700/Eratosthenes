Bitrate Statistics (Mbps)
=========================
Total Files:      4303
Mean Bitrate:     5.71 Mbps
Median Bitrate:   5.86 Mbps
Std Deviation:    1.66 Mbps
95% Conf Interval: [2.46 - 8.95] Mbps

Distribution Context:
 - Files below lower CI might be low quality (Candidates for upgrade).
 - Files above upper CI might be inefficient (Candidates for re-encoding).

=========================
Total Files:      219
Mean Bitrate:     3.33 Mbps
Median Bitrate:   2.96 Mbps
Std Deviation:    1.62 Mbps
95% Conf Interval: [0.16 - 6.50] Mbps

Distribution Context:
 - Files below lower CI might be low quality (Candidates for upgrade).
 - Files above upper CI might be inefficient (Candidates for re-encoding).

Bitrate Statistics (Mbps)
=========================
Total Files:      65
Mean Bitrate:     17.14 Mbps
Median Bitrate:   17.38 Mbps
Std Deviation:    3.54 Mbps
95% Conf Interval: [10.22 - 24.07] Mbps

Distribution Context:
 - Files below lower CI might be low quality (Candidates for upgrade).
 - Files above upper CI might be inefficient (Candidates for re-encoding).

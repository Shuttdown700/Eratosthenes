=========================
Total Files:      43114
Mean Bitrate:     3.06 Mbps
Median Bitrate:   2.84 Mbps
Std Deviation:    1.53 Mbps
95% Conf Interval: [0.07 - 6.06] Mbps

Distribution Context:
 - Files below lower CI might be low quality (Candidates for upgrade).
 - Files above upper CI might be inefficient (Candidates for re-encoding).

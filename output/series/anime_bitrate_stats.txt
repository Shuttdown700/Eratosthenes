Bitrate Statistics (Mbps)
=========================
Total Files:      13036
Mean Bitrate:     2.16 Mbps
Median Bitrate:   1.91 Mbps
Std Deviation:    1.02 Mbps
95% Conf Interval: [0.16 - 4.16] Mbps

Distribution Context:
 - Files below lower CI might be low quality (Candidates for upgrade).
 - Files above upper CI might be inefficient (Candidates for re-encoding).
